2. Create backend grid system
3. Have the fish randomly move & add more fishes
4. What to do if fishes overlap as user taps on it??? Figure this out
    Solution:

Sprint B: Create GUI
1. Create in-game menu (save state, exit, start new game, etc)
2. Create begin and exit function
3. Create user login function
4. Create start menu
